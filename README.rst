Case Conductor UI Python dependencies
=====================================

Python dependencies of the Case Conductor test case management system UI
component.  Pulled in as a submodule of
https://github.com/mozilla/caseconductor-ui/

Packages can be added here with ``pip install --download=. 
packageName==version``.

This repo can be used as the package source for an installation by pointing
pip's ``--find-links`` option at this directory (and optionally using
``--no-index`` to avoid network checks as well).
